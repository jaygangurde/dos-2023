Q.	Write the execution of sample.c to a.out executable binary of c program ?

==>	When we compile sample.c file it will generate some intermediate file these files in the system , that are 

	sample.c -> sample.i  (Preprocessor Code)
	sample.i -> sample.s  (Assembly Code)
	sample.s -> sample.o  (Object Code)
	sample.o -> a.out     (Executable code)
	
	basically for compiling sample.c file we use compiler which is in our system , that compiler run all the process , becouse of that 
      procesess sample.c file genrate a.out file , In preprocessor step it will remove all comments instead of including header file it will 
      expand it. Also it will expand macros also.
	In next step the compiler will convert preprocessed code into assembly language , like sample.i to sample.s the complete code will be 
      in assembly language. Then the same compiler will convert the assembly code in object code , like  sample.s to sample.o , after that all 
	the processes , Finally in last step our object code will create executable file with linking . thats how sample.c convert the a.out .
